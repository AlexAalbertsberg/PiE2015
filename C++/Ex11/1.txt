Question: Why is it OK to use the same integer as a counter for two separate
for loops in the same program, but not if the two form a nested loop?

Answer: Because the integer specified in a for loop is only available within
the scope of the for loop itself. For separate for loops, this means that the
two specified integers do not violate each other's scope. In the nested loop,
the second loop falls within the scope of the first loop, meaning it is not
allowed to redeclare the same integer within its scope.
