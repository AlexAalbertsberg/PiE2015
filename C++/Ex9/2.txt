Question: Can you suggest a flaw in the if/else if/else version of the example program?

Answer: Yes. The last else should check if n is indeed greater than zero. When a user
inserts a character (such as 'x') or a string (such as 'hi') rather than a number, it will also work, even though
the user technically did not insert a number (yeah yeah i know, ASCII character values).
