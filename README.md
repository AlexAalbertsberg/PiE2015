<h1>Programming in Engineering 2015</h1>

This repository holds my source files for the courses 'Programming in Engineering' and 'Advanced Programming in Engineering' at the University of Twente in the course year 2015-2016.

It consists of two parts at the moment: A C++ part and a MATLAB part.

<h2>MATLAB</h2>

Contains .m files (MATLAB scripts) that can be run with MATLAB.

<h2>C++</h2>

Contains the .cpp source files that correspond to the exercises for the C++ part of the course.
